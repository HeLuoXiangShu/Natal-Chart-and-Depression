## 星盤與抑鬱症 Natal Chart and Depression
作为一位命理师，我已经帮助客户解读他们的星盘多年，聆听了各种各样的人生故事。今天，我想从星盘的角度简要探讨抑郁症，并指出需要特别注意的几种人。

抑郁症是一种内在情绪问题。在占星学中，月亮代表一个人的内在情绪，其状态与情绪状态密切相关。通常情况下，那些经常陷入负面情绪的人，其月亮状态较差。月亮的状态由其所处的星座、宫位、相位和格局等因素共同决定。尽管在占星学中，月亮通常象征母亲，但这不是绝对的。例如，如果一个人的母亲对其造成了不良影响，其月亮状态大部分情况下也会较差，但仍有例外。

除了月亮之外，第四宫也与情绪有关。第四宫是整个星盘位置最低的地方，在占星学中通常与地下矿藏有关。那么一个人他的位置最低的最深处的地方是什么？是一个人的情绪情商。

接下来，我将通过举例说明需要特别注意的几种人。

As an astrologer, I have been helping clients interpret their astrological charts for many years, listening to a myriad of life stories. Today, I would like to briefly explore depression from the perspective of astrology, and point out several types of individuals who need special attention.

Depression is an internal emotional issue. In astrology, the Moon represents a person's internal emotions, its state is closely related to emotional status. Generally, those who often fall into negative emotions have a poorly placed Moon. The state of the Moon is determined by factors such as its zodiac sign, house placement, aspects, and patterns. Although in astrology, the Moon usually symbolizes the mother, this is not absolute. For example, if a person's mother has had a negative impact on them, their Moon is likely poorly placed in most cases, but there are exceptions.

In addition to the Moon, the Fourth House is also related to emotions. The Fourth House is the lowest point in the entire astrological chart, often associated with underground minerals in astrology. So, what is the deepest and lowest place for a person? It's their emotional intelligence.

Next, through examples, I will highlight several types of individuals who need special attention.

###决定月亮状态的四大因素 Four major factors determining the state of the Moon:
####月亮所处的星座 The sign where the Moon is placed
不考虑宫位的情况下，月亮落在巨蟹座和金牛座是比较强势的位置，月亮落在天蝎座和魔羯座是比较弱势的位置。

当一个人的月亮落在天蝎座时，他可能会在成长环境中受到他人强制行为的影响，这些行为有利或有害，都可能没有充分考虑到他的情感需求，因此会产生抵触情绪。举例来说，我曾接待一位客户，她的丈夫和闺蜜出轨后离婚，甚至忽略了他们的儿子。这位客户经常告诉年幼的儿子：“你父亲出轨了，男人不应该这样做。”母亲这种抱怨行为是一种将个人情绪倾泻给无辜受害者的不良行为，对前夫无可奈何，又无处发泄情绪，幼小的儿子成为了母亲的情绪垃圾桶。这种行为本质上是一种控制欲，试图控制前夫的行为，甚至控制儿子的情感状态。
在这样的环境中长大的孩子，很容易出现自我责备的情况。这种自我责备源于母亲的控制欲，孩子可能会认为自己的情感需要不被重视，甚至认为自己应该为父亲的出轨负责。这种情况对孩子的情感成长和健康发展产生不良影响。
因此，对于月亮落在天蝎座的人来说，重要的是要学会正视自己的情感需求和情感困扰，并找到健康有效的方式来表达和释放情感。同时，对于成长环境中存在的不良行为，需要学会保持理性和客观，不要过度责怪自己或他人。

当月亮落在魔羯座的时候，命主在成长环境中易受到所谓“应该怎样做”的教育，这种教育如果非常理性和合理，那么对命主的情绪影响相对较小。但如果这种教育是自以为是、不太合理的，则可能对命主的情绪造成不良影响。如果月亮位于魔羯座的第九宫，并且没有受到其他行星的不良影响，那么命主的母亲可能会非常喜欢给孩子讲道理，这种讲道理往往是合理的、无法反驳的。因此，在这种情况下，最多只会让孩子有一点点压抑的感觉，但整体上影响不大。
但是，如果月亮落在魔羯座，但宫位不佳，或者受到其他行星的不良影响，那么命主的母亲可能会成为那种不考虑孩子情绪、一直输出个人观点的人，这对孩子的情绪可能会造成长期的压抑。
总之，如果您的孩子月亮在魔羯座，在教育孩子的时候，要平衡理性和感性，不要只强调道理而忽略孩子的情感需求。

Without considering the houses, the Moon in Cancer and Taurus are strong placements, while the Moon in Scorpio and Capricorn are weak placements.

When a person's Moon is in Scorpio, they may be affected by coercive behaviors from others in their growth environment. These behaviors, whether beneficial or harmful, may not take into account their emotional needs, thus causing emotional resistance. For instance, I once had a client whose husband and best friend cheated on her and divorced, even neglecting their son. This client often told her young son: "Your father cheated, men shouldn't do this." This type of complaining behavior is a harmful act of dumping personal emotions onto an innocent victim, with the young son becoming the mother's emotional trash can. This behavior is essentially a form of control, trying to control the behavior of the ex-husband, and even the emotional state of the son. 
Children growing up in such an environment often exhibit self-blame, rooted in the mother's controlling behavior. The child may feel their emotional needs are not valued and may even feel responsible for the father's infidelity. This situation adversely affects the child's emotional growth and healthy development.
Therefore, for people with the Moon in Scorpio, it's important to learn to face their emotional needs and struggles, and to find healthy and effective ways to express and release emotions. At the same time, for the harmful behaviors in the growth environment, one needs to learn to remain rational and objective, and not to overly blame oneself or others.

When the Moon is in Capricorn, the native is likely to receive a "should" education in their growing environment. If this type of education is very rational and reasonable, then its impact on the native's emotions is relatively small. But if this education is self-righteous and unreasonable, it can have a negative effect on the native's emotions. If the Moon is in Capricorn in the Ninth House and is not adversely affected by other planets, then the native's mother may enjoy lecturing the child, and these lectures are often reasonable and irrefutable. Therefore, in this case, it may at most make the child feel a little repressed, but overall the impact is not significant.
However, if the Moon is in Capricorn but the house placement is not good, or it is adversely affected by other planets, then the native's mother may become the kind of person who doesn't consider the child's emotions, constantly voicing personal opinions, which may cause long-term repression to the child's emotions.
In conclusion, if your child's Moon is in Capricorn, when educating the child, balance rationality and sentimentality. Don't just emphasize reason while ignoring the child's emotional needs.

####月亮所处的宫位 The house where the Moon is placed
如果一个人的月亮落在第六宫或第八宫，他的情绪很容易受到负面影响。

第六宫是处女座的能量，处女座追求完美，这种追求容易让人沉迷于琐碎的细节中。如果这种能量应用于工作中，可以成为一个优秀的员工。但月亮代表一个人的情绪，如果落在第六宫，就可能陷入困惑、烦恼、不断纠结的情绪当中，久而久之，可能会产生抑郁情绪。

同样地，第八宫经常与阴暗的隐晦事物有关，当月亮落在这个宫位时，情绪很容易陷入黑暗中，难以走出来。如果缺乏发泄的途径，容易导致抑郁情绪。因此，月亮落在这些宫位的人需要特别关注自己的情绪状态，学习有效地处理情绪，找到健康的发泄方式，如艺术创作、运动、冥想等，以减少负面情绪对自己的影响。
If a person's Moon is located in the sixth or eighth house, their emotions are easily influenced by negative factors.

The sixth house is associated with the energy of Virgo, which seeks perfection and can become obsessed with trivial details. When this energy is applied to work, it can make for an excellent employee. However, the Moon represents a person's emotions, and if it falls in the sixth house, it can lead to confusion, worry, and constant overthinking, which can eventually lead to depression.

Similarly, the eighth house is often associated with dark and hidden matters, and when the Moon falls in this house, emotions can easily become trapped in darkness and become difficult to escape. If there is no outlet for release, it can lead to depression. Therefore, people with their Moon in these houses need to pay special attention to their emotional state, learn to effectively process their emotions, and find healthy outlets for release such as art, exercise, meditation, etc., to reduce the negative impact of their emotions on themselves.

####月亮的相位 Aspects of the Moon
在占星学中，月亮的相位种类繁多。以下以一个例子来说明：假设一个人的出生盘中，月亮和金星合相于处女座，落入第四宫。接下来我们将分析三个因素，并将它们叠加起来。

月亮位于处女座，代表月亮受到处女座的影响。处女座的守护行星是水星，因此月亮也受到水星的影响。水星是一颗喜欢思考和辩论的行星，因此月亮处于处女座的人天生倾向于思考许多事情。

月亮和金星合相代表月亮受到金星的影响。接下来我们将分析金星在处女座的状态。金星与享乐、感情和人际关系有关，喜欢轻松浪漫的氛围，注重体验。然而处女座喜欢讲究事实证据和分析问题，所以金星在处女座的人不容易相信感受，而更喜欢相信证据。这种情况下，这些人在感情世界里不容易轻松愉快，因此金星位于处女座是落陷的。这种严格的标准和完美主义可能会让这个人陷入情绪困境中，尤其是当他们感觉自己无法达到自己或他人的期望时。他们可能会感到沮丧、焦虑、不安和自我怀疑，进而影响自己的情绪状态。

第四宫与情感和家庭有关，是一个人内心最深处的情绪和安全感。月亮和金星合相落入第四宫，对第四宫造成了不良影响，使情绪出现了问题。这是因为月亮和金星在处女座的状态使得这些人对情感和人际关系有着谨慎和完美主义的期望，而这种期望与现实往往不符，进而影响到他们的情绪和家庭关系。

总的来说，以上三个因素的叠加可能会导致情绪困境，尤其是在感情和家庭方面。因此，这些人需要学会放松标准和降低期望值，并学会接受自己和他人的不完美。

In astrology, there are many different types of aspects of the Moon. Let's take an example: Suppose in someone's natal chart, the moon conjuncts Venus in Virgo, falling into the 4th house. Next we will analyze three factors and combine them together.

The moon is in Virgo, meaning it is influenced by Virgo. Virgo's ruling planet is Mercury, so the moon is also affected by Mercury. Mercury is a planet that likes thinking and debating, so people with the moon in Virgo are inherently inclined to ponder many things.

The moon conjuncting Venus means the moon is influenced by Venus. Next we will analyze the condition of Venus in Virgo. Venus relates to pleasure, emotions and relationships, and likes a relaxed, romantic atmosphere. However, Virgo prefers relying on facts and analyzing problems, so people with Venus in Virgo don't easily trust feelings, rather believing in evidence. In this case, these people don't easily have a lighthearted, joyful experience in relationships, so Venus in Virgo is in debilitated. This strict standard and perfectionism may cause this person to fall into emotional turmoil, especially when they feel they can't meet their own or others' expectations. They may feel frustrated, anxious, insecure and self-doubting, which in turn impacts their emotional state.

The fourth house is associated with emotions and family, representing a person's deepest emotions and sense of security. The Moon conjunct Venus in the fourth house has a negative impact on the fourth house, causing emotional problems. This is because the Moon conjunct Venus in Virgo makes these individuals cautious and perfectionistic in emotions and relationships, which often do not match reality and can affect their emotional and family relationships.

Overall, the combination of these three factors can lead to emotional difficulties, especially in emotions and family. Therefore, these individuals need to learn to relax their standards, lower their expectations, and accept themselves and others' imperfections.

####月亮的格局 Yogas of the Moon
最后，让我们谈谈格局的影响。有些人可能会说：“我的月亮落在天蝎座，但是我母亲对我很好，我也没有太多情绪问题。”这当然是可能的，因为格局也会影响月亮的力量。

例如，有些人的月亮落在天蝎座，但是在九分盘中，月亮也落在天蝎座。在这种情况下，这个人的命盘就形成了一个叫做Vargottama的格局，这种格局会增强行星的力量。因此，即使月亮落在天蝎座，也可能不会受到太大的不良影响。

再例如，有些人的月亮位于天蝎座，但是火星位于巨蟹座，这种情况下就形成了月亮与火星互溶的格局。这种位置的影响可以让月亮和火星的能量相互增强，月亮天蝎但不论落陷。

Finally, let's talk about how yogas can influence the effects. Some people might say: "My moon is in Scorpio, but my mother treated me well and I don't have too many emotional issues." This is certainly possible, because yogas can also influence the moon's power. 

For example, some people have their moon in Scorpio, but in the Navamsha chart, the moon is also in Scorpio. In this case, the person's chart forms a yoga called Vargottama, which enhances the strength of the planet. So even with the moon in Scorpio, it may not face too many adverse effects.

As another example, some people have their moon in Scorpio, but Mars is in Cancer. This forms a mutual receptions yoga between the moon and Mars. The influence of this placement can allow the energies of the moon and Mars to enhance each other, so the moon in Scorpio is not necessarily debilitated.

###情绪的储藏室——第四宫The Emotional Storehouse - The 4th House

第四宫通常与家庭、情感和内心感受有关。如果第四宫受到不良影响，可能会导致个人在家庭和情感方面感到沮丧和孤独，甚至导致抑郁症的出现。

例如，火星代表活力、冲动和挑战精神。如果火星落在第四宫，可能会导致个人在家庭环境中感到紧张和不安，尤其是在家庭成员之间存在冲突和争吵的情况下。这种紧张情绪可能会给个人的情感和内心感受带来负面影响，导致沮丧、孤独和抑郁等问题。

然而，需要注意的是，不仅火星，其他行星和宫位的影响也可能会对第四宫产生不良影响，从而增加抑郁症的风险。例如，落陷的土星位於第四宮，會帶來家庭和情感基础造成一些挑战。由于土星落陷，这个人可能会发现自己在家庭和情感关系中遇到了很多障碍和困难。他们可能会感到孤独、沮丧和不被理解。

The 4th house is usually associated with home, emotions and inner feelings. If the 4th house is adversely impacted, it can lead to frustration and loneliness for the individual in terms of family and relationships, and potentially even depression.

For example, Mars represents drive, impulsiveness and a challenging spirit. If Mars falls in the 4th house, it may cause tension and unease for the individual within the home environment, especially when there is conflict and arguments between family members. This tense emotion can bring negative influences to one's feelings and inner state, leading to problems like low mood, loneliness and depression.  

However, it's worth noting that not only Mars, but other planetary and house influences could also adversely affect the 4th house, thereby increasing the risks of depression. For example, a debilitated Saturn in the 4th house can bring some challenges to the foundations of home and emotions. Due to the debilitation, the person may encounter a lot of obstacles and difficulties in family and emotional relationships. They may feel lonely, frustrated and misunderstood.
