## 星盤與抑鬱症 Natal Chart and Depression
作為一位命理師，我已經幫助客戶解讀他們的星盤多年，聆聽了各種各樣的人生故事。今天，我想從星盤的角度簡要探討抑鬱症，並指出需要特別注意的幾種人。

抑鬱症是一種內在情緒問題。在占星學中，月亮代表一個人的內在情緒，其狀態與情緒狀態密切相關。通常情況下，那些經常陷入負面情緒的人，其月亮狀態較差。月亮的狀態由其所處的星座、宮位、相位和格局等因素共同決定。儘管在占星學中，月亮通常象徵母親，但這不是絕對的。例如，如果一個人的母親對其造成了不良影響，其月亮狀態大部分情況下也會較差，但仍有例外。

除了月亮之外，第四宮也與情緒有關。第四宮是整個星盤位置最低的地方，在占星學中通常與地下礦藏有關。那麼一個人他的位置最低的最深處的地方是什麼？是一個人的情緒情商。

接下來，我將通過举例說明需要特别注意的几种人。

As an astrologer, I have been helping clients interpret their astrological charts for many years, listening to a myriad of life stories. Today, I would like to briefly explore depression from the perspective of astrology, and point out several types of individuals who need special attention.

Depression is an internal emotional issue. In astrology, the Moon represents a person's internal emotions, its state is closely related to emotional status. Generally, those who often fall into negative emotions have a poorly placed Moon. The state of the Moon is determined by factors such as its zodiac sign, house placement, aspects, and patterns. Although in astrology, the Moon usually symbolizes the mother, this is not absolute. For example, if a person's mother has had a negative impact on them, their Moon is likely poorly placed in most cases, but there are exceptions.

In addition to the Moon, the Fourth House is also related to emotions. The Fourth House is the lowest point in the entire astrological chart, often associated with underground minerals in astrology. So, what is the deepest and lowest place for a person? It's their emotional intelligence.

Next, through examples, I will highlight several types of individuals who need special attention.

### 決定月亮狀態的四大因素 Four major factors determining the state of the Moon:
#### 月亮所處的星座 The sign where the Moon is placed

不考慮宮位的情況下，月亮落在巨蟹座和金牛座是比較強勢的位置，月亮落在天蠍座和魔羯座是比較弱勢的位置。

當一個人的月亮落在天蠍座時，他可能會在成長環境中受到他人強制行為的影響，這些行為有利或有害，都可能沒有充分考慮到他的情感需求，因此會產生抵觸情緒。舉例來說，我曾接待一位客戶，她的丈夫和閨蜜出軌後離婚，甚至忽略了他們的兒子。這位客戶經常告訴年幼的兒子：“你父親出軌了，男人不應該這樣做。”母親這種抱怨行為是一種將個人情緒傾泻給無辜受害者的不良行為，對前夫無可奈何，又無處發泄情緒，幼小的兒子成為了母親的情緒垃圾桶。這種行為本質上是一種控制欲，試圖控制前夫的行為，甚至控制兒子的情感狀態。
在這樣的環境中長大的孩子，很容易出現自我責備的情況。這種自我責備源於母親的控制欲，孩子可能會認為自己的情感需要不被重視，甚至認為自己應該為父親的出軌負責。這種情況對孩子的情感成長和健康發展產生不良影響。
因此，對於月亮落在天蠍座的人來說，重要的是要學會正視自己的情感需求和情感困擾，並找到健康有效的方式來表達和釋放情感。同時，對於成長環境中存在的不良行為，需要學會保持理性和客觀，不要過度責怪自己或他人。

當月亮落在魔羯座的時候，命主在成長環境中易受到所謂“應該怎樣做”的教育，這種教育如果非常理性和合理，那麼對命主的情緒影響相對較小。但如果這種教育是自以為是、不太合理的，則可能對命主的情緒造成不良影響。如果月亮位於魔羯座的第九宮，並且沒有受到其他行星的不良影響，那麼命主的母親可能會非常喜歡給孩子講道理，這種講道理往往是合理的、無法反駁的。因此，在這種情況下，最多只會讓孩子有一點點壓抑的感覺，但整體上影響不大。
但是，如果月亮落在魔羯座，但宮位不佳，或者受到其他行星的不良影響，那麼命主的母親可能會成為那種不考慮孩子情緒、一直輸出個人觀點的人，這對孩子的情緒可能會造成長期的壓抑。
總之，如果您的孩子月亮在魔羯座，在教育孩子的時候，要平衡理性和感性，不要只強調道理而忽略孩子的情感需求。

Without considering the houses, the Moon in Cancer and Taurus are strong placements, while the Moon in Scorpio and Capricorn are weak placements.

When a person's Moon is in Scorpio, they may be affected by coercive behaviors from others in their growth environment. These behaviors, whether beneficial or harmful, may not take into account their emotional needs, thus causing emotional resistance. For instance, I once had a client whose husband and best friend cheated on her and divorced, even neglecting their son. This client often told her young son: "Your father cheated, men shouldn't do this." This type of complaining behavior is a harmful act of dumping personal emotions onto an innocent victim, with the young son becoming the mother's emotional trash can. This behavior is essentially a form of control, trying to control the behavior of the ex-husband, and even the emotional state of the son. 
Children growing up in such an environment often exhibit self-blame, rooted in the mother's controlling behavior. The child may feel their emotional needs are not valued and may even feel responsible for the father's infidelity. This situation adversely affects the child's emotional growth and healthy development.
Therefore, for people with the Moon in Scorpio, it's important to learn to face their emotional needs and struggles, and to find healthy and effective ways to express and release emotions. At the same time, for the harmful behaviors in the growth environment, one needs to learn to remain rational and objective, and not to overly blame oneself or others.

When the Moon is in Capricorn, the native is likely to receive a "should" education in their growing environment. If this type of education is very rational and reasonable, then its impact on the native's emotions is relatively small. But if this education is self-righteous and unreasonable, it can have a negative effect on the native's emotions. If the Moon is in Capricorn in the Ninth House and is not adversely affected by other planets, then the native's mother may enjoy lecturing the child, and these lectures are often reasonable and irrefutable. Therefore, in this case, it may at most make the child feel a little repressed, but overall the impact is not significant.
However, if the Moon is in Capricorn but the house placement is not good, or it is adversely affected by other planets, then the native's mother may become the kind of person who doesn't consider the child's emotions, constantly voicing personal opinions, which may cause long-term repression to the child's emotions.
In conclusion, if your child's Moon is in Capricorn, when educating the child, balance rationality and sentimentality. Don't just emphasize reason while ignoring the child's emotional needs.

#### 月亮所處的宮位 The house where the Moon is placed
如果一個人的月亮落在第六宮或第八宮，他的情緒很容易受到負面影響。

第六宮是處女座的能量，處女座追求完美，這種追求容易讓人沉迷於瑣碎的細節中。如果這種能量應用於工作中，可以成為一個優秀的員工。但月亮代表一個人的情緒，如果落在第六宮，就可能陷入困惑、煩惱、不斷紐結的情緒當中，久而久之，可能會產生抑鬱情緒。

同樣地，第八宮經常與陰暗的隱晦事物有關，當月亮落在這個宮位時，情緒很容易陷入黑暗中，難以走出來。如果缺乏發洩的途徑，容易導致抑鬱情緒。因此，月亮落在這些宮位的人需要特別關注自己的情緒狀態，學習有效地處理情緒，找到健康的發洩方式，如藝術創作、運動、冥想等，以減少負面情緒對自己的影響。

If a person's Moon is located in the sixth or eighth house, their emotions are easily influenced by negative factors.

The sixth house is associated with the energy of Virgo, which seeks perfection and can become obsessed with trivial details. When this energy is applied to work, it can make for an excellent employee. However, the Moon represents a person's emotions, and if it falls in the sixth house, it can lead to confusion, worry, and constant overthinking, which can eventually lead to depression.

Similarly, the eighth house is often associated with dark and hidden matters, and when the Moon falls in this house, emotions can easily become trapped in darkness and become difficult to escape. If there is no outlet for release, it can lead to depression. Therefore, people with their Moon in these houses need to pay special attention to their emotional state, learn to effectively process their emotions, and find healthy outlets for release such as art, exercise, meditation, etc., to reduce the negative impact of their emotions on themselves.

#### 月亮的相位 Aspects of the Moon
在占星學中，月亮的相位種類繁多。以下以一個例子來說明：假設一個人的出生盤中，月亮和金星合相於處女座，落入第四宮。接下來我們將分析三個因素，並將它們疊加起來。

月亮位於處女座，代表月亮受到處女座的影響。處女座的守護行星是水星，因此月亮也受到水星的影響。水星是一顆喜歡思考和辯論的行星，因此月亮處於處女座的人天生傾向於思考許多事情。

月亮和金星合相代表月亮受到金星的影響。接下來我們將分析金星在處女座的狀態。金星與享樂、感情和人際關係有關，喜歡輕鬆浪漫的氛圍，注重體驗。然而處女座喜歡講究事實證據和分析問題，所以金星在處女座的人不容易相信感受，而更喜歡相信證據。這種情況下，這些人在感情世界裡不容易輕鬆愉快，因此金星位於處女座是落陷的。這種嚴格的標準和完美主義可能會讓這個人陷入情緒困境中，尤其是當他們感覺自己無法達到自己或他人的期望時。他們可能會感到沮喪、焦慮、不安和自我懷疑，進而影響自己的情緒狀態。

第四宮與情感和家庭有關，是一個人內心最深處的情緒和安全感。月亮和金星合相落入第四宮，對第四宮造成了不良影響，使情緒出現了問題。這是因為月亮和金星在處女座的狀態使得這些人對情感和人際關係有著謹慎和完美主義的期望，而這種期望與現實往往不符，進而影響到他們的情緒和家庭關係。

總的來說，以上三個因素的疊加可能會導致情緒困境，尤其是在感情和家庭方面。因此，這些人需要學會放鬆標準和降低期望值，並學會接受自己和他人的不完美。

In astrology, there are many different types of aspects of the Moon. Let's take an example: Suppose in someone's natal chart, the moon conjuncts Venus in Virgo, falling into the 4th house. Next we will analyze three factors and combine them together.

The moon is in Virgo, meaning it is influenced by Virgo. Virgo's ruling planet is Mercury, so the moon is also affected by Mercury. Mercury is a planet that likes thinking and debating, so people with the moon in Virgo are inherently inclined to ponder many things.

The moon conjuncting Venus means the moon is influenced by Venus. Next we will analyze the condition of Venus in Virgo. Venus relates to pleasure, emotions and relationships, and likes a relaxed, romantic atmosphere. However, Virgo prefers relying on facts and analyzing problems, so people with Venus in Virgo don't easily trust feelings, rather believing in evidence. In this case, these people don't easily have a lighthearted, joyful experience in relationships, so Venus in Virgo is in debilitated. This strict standard and perfectionism may cause this person to fall into emotional turmoil, especially when they feel they can't meet their own or others' expectations. They may feel frustrated, anxious, insecure and self-doubting, which in turn impacts their emotional state.

The fourth house is associated with emotions and family, representing a person's deepest emotions and sense of security. The Moon conjunct Venus in the fourth house has a negative impact on the fourth house, causing emotional problems. This is because the Moon conjunct Venus in Virgo makes these individuals cautious and perfectionistic in emotions and relationships, which often do not match reality and can affect their emotional and family relationships.

Overall, the combination of these three factors can lead to emotional difficulties, especially in emotions and family. Therefore, these individuals need to learn to relax their standards, lower their expectations, and accept themselves and others' imperfections.

#### 月亮的格局 Yogas of the Moon
最後，讓我們談談格局的影響。有些人可能會說：“我的月亮落在天蠍座，但是我母親對我很好，我也沒有太多情緒問題。”這當然是可能的，因為格局也會影響月亮的力量。

例如，有些人的月亮落在天蠍座，但是在九分盤中，月亮也落在天蠍座。在這種情況下，這個人的命盤就形成了一個叫做Vargottama的格局，這種格局會增強行星的力量。因此，即使月亮落在天蠍座，也可能不會受到太大的不良影響。

再例如，有些人的月亮位於天蠍座，但是火星位於巨蟹座，這種情況下就形成了月亮與火星互溶的格局。這種位置的影響可以讓月亮和火星的能量相互增強，月亮天蠍但不論落陷。

Finally, let's talk about how yogas can influence the effects. Some people might say: "My moon is in Scorpio, but my mother treated me well and I don't have too many emotional issues." This is certainly possible, because yogas can also influence the moon's power. 

For example, some people have their moon in Scorpio, but in the Navamsha chart, the moon is also in Scorpio. In this case, the person's chart forms a yoga called Vargottama, which enhances the strength of the planet. So even with the moon in Scorpio, it may not face too many adverse effects.

As another example, some people have their moon in Scorpio, but Mars is in Cancer. This forms a mutual receptions yoga between the moon and Mars. The influence of this placement can allow the energies of the moon and Mars to enhance each other, so the moon in Scorpio is not necessarily debilitated.

### 情緒的儲藏室——第四宮 The Emotional Storehouse - The 4th House

第四宮通常與家庭、情感和內心感受有關。如果第四宮受到不良影響，可能會導致個人在家庭和情感方面感到沮喪和孤獨，甚至導致抑鬱症的出現。

例如，火星代表活力、衝動和挑戰精神。如果火星落在第四宮，可能會導致個人在家庭環境中感到緊張和不安，尤其是在家庭成員之間存在衝突和爭吵的情況下。這種緊張情緒可能會給個人的情感和內心感受帶來負面影響，導致沮喪、孤獨和抑鬱等問題。

然而，需要注意的是，不僅火星，其他行星和宮位的影響也可能會對第四宮產生不良影響，從而增加抑鬱症的風險。例如，落陷的土星位於第四宮，會帶來家庭和情感基礎造成一些挑戰。由於土星落陷，這個人可能會發現自己在家庭和情感關係中遇到了很多障礙和困難。他們可能會感到孤獨、沮喪和不被理解。

The 4th house is usually associated with home, emotions and inner feelings. If the 4th house is adversely impacted, it can lead to frustration and loneliness for the individual in terms of family and relationships, and potentially even depression.

For example, Mars represents drive, impulsiveness and a challenging spirit. If Mars falls in the 4th house, it may cause tension and unease for the individual within the home environment, especially when there is conflict and arguments between family members. This tense emotion can bring negative influences to one's feelings and inner state, leading to problems like low mood, loneliness and depression.  

However, it's worth noting that not only Mars, but other planetary and house influences could also adversely affect the 4th house, thereby increasing the risks of depression. For example, a debilitated Saturn in the 4th house can bring some challenges to the foundations of home and emotions. Due to the debilitation, the person may encounter a lot of obstacles and difficulties in family and emotional relationships. They may feel lonely, frustrated and misunderstood.
